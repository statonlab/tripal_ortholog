The Tripal Ortholog module is being developed to allow HWG to track syntenic groups of features and as a starting point for enabling comparative genomics.

The module is briefly outlined [here](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Group_Module
).  As far as I can tell, the alternatives used in discussion (a feature that is a group, or using featureprops) are inferior to a dedicated module.

Initial implementation will focus on defining feature orthogroups, but a good implementation should be generic for the module. The thing is, I don't have a lot of info to go on for this module.  Why would I create groups of organisms in this context?  As a genera?    So we'll focus on feature groups here.



This module is under active development.
